 * Function 'ProcessInput'.
 *
 * We first read the number of distinct lines of input data that follow.
 * We then read each of these lines.
 * Each line is
 *   a label of the item
 *   the number of each item bought
 *   and the cost per item.
 *
 * As we read, we output the running grocery receipt and keep a running
 * total, which is then output at the end.
 *
 * We are not going to worry about formatting in this program. That will
 * come later. For now, we will be content just to output the right values.
